# Odin Flight Booker

Odin Flight Booker is an exercise in building nested forms.  It mimicks the basic functionality of a flight booking website such as Travelocity.  Users choose a flight from a pre-populated form of available flights based on four characteristics: departure airport, arrival airport, date of flight, and number of passengers.  

Once a user has chosen a flight, booking information for each passenger is collected and saved into the database.
